# Manual Deployment Openstack HA and Integrate with Ceph

If you're reading this I assume you've heard of Openstack and Ceph, or maybe you've tried to deploy them. Often openstack and ceph deployments are done using tools such as ansible for openstack or for ceph, the famous one is cephadm.

But have you ever thought of deploying it without the tools I mentioned earlier? Maybe this idea sounds like a waste of time, but I think this experiment can make us know more about the components in openstack and ceph, and better know how the components work together.

So, let's get right to it!
